                        <p>
                            Built an indoor navigation mobile application that can be used by firefighters. Firefighters
                            may not have enough time to prepare to learn the most optimal route to the exit in such
                            short time. This application allows the firefighter to download the blueprints of the
                            desired building from a respository which contains all plans of that locality. Using passive
                            RFID tags placed throughout the building, the location of the firefighter is triangulated
                            and shown on the map along with the directions to the closest exit. Audio commands are given
                            through the bluetooth earpiece for easier mobility. The application is still under
                            development to accommodate real-time changes in floor plan based on the building collapsing.
                            This can be done by the firefighting chief who stands outside and can provide guidance to
                            all this crew as he will be able to see where all his members are.

                            <p>
                                Students are always looking to learn more and alumni always like to be connected to
                                their alma mater. This app allows both students and alumni of an institution to sign up.
                                The alumni have clubs and events and students have their own. The students can directly
                                contact and connect with alumni who are willing to mentor the young budding talents.
                            </p>
